#question - write a program to find sum of element in list


number = [20,30,40,50,60,70]
#initialize a variable to store the sum of the list 
sum = 0
#iterate through the list and accumulate the sum of the elements
for i in number:
    sum += i
print(f"Sum of the elements in the list is {sum}")




#with logger
from loguru import logger
import math

number = [20,30,40,50,60,70]
sum = 0
for i in number:
    sum += i
logger.info(f"Sum of the elements in the list is {sum}")
